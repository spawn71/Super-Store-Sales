## Tools

* Python - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps to Solve:

### Data Collection: 
  * Obtain the dataset containing information about customers, orders, and products. This dataset may include attributes such as customer demographics, order details (e.g., order date,       quantity, sales), and product information (e.g., category, price).
### Data Preprocessing: 
* Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables, correlations, and outliers.
* Visualize key metrics such as sales trends over time, distribution of customers by demographics, and popular product categories.
### Customer Segmentation:
* Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-means clustering) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.
* Analyze the characteristics of each segment to understand the distinct groups of customers.
### Sales Analysis:
*Analyze sales data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and factors influencing sales.
* Explore the relationship between sales and various factors such as promotions, discounts, and product categories.

* Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, insights, and recommendations.
* Optionally, create interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI to enable stakeholders to explore the data interactively.
